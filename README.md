# About project 
This is a simple Russian game. RPG without levels (and that was my decision).

# About gameplay
What's in it?
- Fight enemies and get items to sell/use.
- Trade or sell with a merchant with different items and prices.
- Relax at your own camp, but your rest can be interrupted by enemies!

Pros:
- Endless gameplay.
- Various items.

Cons:
- Monotonous gameplay.
- In the endgame you are practically immortal, but it is very difficult to get past this stage (I tried).

# About project updates
This is the final version (in my opinion) of this project, but if you think it's not finished, then finish it.
For example, you can translate my game or improve the game balance (I set it to almost random).
